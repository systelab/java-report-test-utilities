# Report Utilities library

This is a Java library with some utilities to check if two files are equal or different. 
It could be useful to verify that a file generated by a given code, is compliant with a golden copy. 

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `java-report-test-utilities` repository and install the dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You need [git][git] to clone the `java-report-test-utilities` repository.

You will need [Javaâ„¢ SE Development Kit 8][jdk-download] and [Maven][maven].

### Clone

Clone the `java-report-test-utilities` repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/systelab/java-report-test-utilities.git
cd java-report-test-utilities
```

### Install Dependencies

In order to install the dependencies, you must run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Release

In order to release a new version:

Step 1. Update the version in your pom.xml file. For example:

```
<version>1.2.0</version>
```

Step 2. Commit and push in the master branch, and generate a new Release by pressing the button "Draft new release".

In the example use v.1.2.0 as the Tag version, and 1.2.0 as the release title.

Step 3. Head to https://jitpack.io and look up "systelab/java-report-test-utilities". Choose the new version and press the button "Get it". Check the log to verify that everything is fine.


## Using the library

In order to use the library, you should add the dependency to your project.

### Dependency 
#### Gradle

In order to use the library, you should:

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.systelab:java-report-test-utilities:v1.2.0'
}
```

#### Maven

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.systelab</groupId>
	    <artifactId>java-report-test-utilities</artifactId>
	    <version>v1.2.0</version>
	</dependency>
```

### Code

Use **PDFComparator** and **ExcelComparator** compareFiles method as needed. 

```java
public static ComparisonResult compareFiles(File expectedFile, File actualFile)
```

In a Unit Test, to assert that files are equal or different, it is suggested to use the *assertEquals* and *assertNotEquals* static methods in the **ComparisonResultAssertions** utility class.

For example:

```java
    @Test
    public void compareFilesEqual() throws IOException {
        File file = new File(RESOURCE_PATH + "file1.pdf");
        ComparisonResultAssertions.assertEquals(compareFiles(file, file));
    }


    @Test
    public void compareFilesNotEqual() throws IOException {
        File expectedFile = new File(RESOURCE_PATH + "file1.pdf");
        File actualFile = new File(RESOURCE_PATH + "file2.pdf");
        ComparisonResultAssertions.assertNotEquals(compareFiles(expectedFile, actualFile));
    }
```
